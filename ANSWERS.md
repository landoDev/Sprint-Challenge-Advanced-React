- [x] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

    * Hooks are relatively new and there is a lot of legacy code that deals with state using class components. Other than that it allows us to tap into a pool of curated methods for the Component Lifestyle; giving us control over how our components work.

- [x] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

    * Mounting: Initializing data and initial mounting of the component
    * Updating: updating component data with setState() (forces another render)
    * Unmounting: Remove component from screen

- [x] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

    * Building custom hooks allows us to skip writing out all the stateful logic and make reuseable code.

- [x] Why is it important to test our apps?

    * With testing we can find bugs faster, reduce risk of breaking code, allows to trust our code, and can act as documentation for our code. It provides a safety net and allows us to write better code.
